Git on Yer Happy Trails!
========================

By [James Ward](http://jamesward.com "James' Blog") and [Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com "Matt's Blog").

Happy Trails is a web application that was written in Play 2 (Java) and Grails 2 in order to do a side-by-side comparison of the two frameworks. The results of this comparison were initially [presented at UberConf](http://uberconf.com/conference/denver/2012/06/session?id=25584) on June 21, 2012. If you'd like to read more about this session and its conclusions, see [Play vs. Grails Smackdown at ÃœberConf](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/play_vs_grails_smackdown_at).

The applications were updated for Play 2.1.0 and Grails 2.2.1 and findings were [presented at Devoxx France](http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR13/Play+Framework+vs.+Grails+Smackdown) on March 28, 2013.
